Regression Tests
================

This directory contains regression tests.  Running `make` produces out/test-* files that may be inspected and compared.  Note that the Makefile expects specific numbered pandoc executables (e.g., pandoc-2.7.3) to be available.  You will need to adapt the Makefile to use what is available on your system.
